A part of a project. 
I was responsible for some pages. Used HTML, CSS, LESS. The project is responsive/adaptive.<br /> 
!!! All images are loaded according to a screen resolution.

In order to run:
npm install<br />
npm -g install gulp-cli<br />
npm run build && gulp serve<br /><br />

Or just open build/ and open index.html in a browser
